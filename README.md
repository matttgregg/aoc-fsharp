## Advent of code solutions in FSharp

Some solutions to the fabulous advent of code (https://adventofcode.com/2018)
Partly done as general code practice, partly to develop F# and functional techniques.

Note that:
  * These are fairly non-optimal. They're done fairly quickly for a specific purpose.
  * I've often done things failry uncleanly in order to experiment with a particular language feature.
  * Part of my interest is how easy is it to use F# for quick, ad-hoc prototyping.

That in mind, I've enjoyed a lot. It's been extremely useful to investigate the basics of FParsec (no regex parsing!), and leverage the type system and pattern matching approach.
